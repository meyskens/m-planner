# M-Planner

M-Planner is an all-in-one life planning tool optimised for Maartje's weird brain... The M stands for Maartje but also is a very obscure reference to the M-Decreet.

This tool is fit for my inner thoughts to be organised, happy to share my work but I will probably not accept feature requests for things I have no need for. Forking of course is fine!

## The interfaces

There are several interfaces to to interact with this tool:

### Discord bot

Since I always have Discord open and nobody needs yet another open browser tab the primary interface for this app is a Discord bot!

### REST API

**Coming soon** an API for things like Smartwatch apps or something...

### Thermal printer

**Coming soon** a printer in the real world for all reminders

## Constructs

Not all tasks are equal, M-Planner has them in different categories.

### "Idea"

An Idea is a task that should be done but is a nice-to-have. It allows for non time critical tasks to be kept and shown up as ideas on slow days. They are strictly not critical!

### Tasks

Tasks are one-off things that have to be done before a certain time. Not doing this will negatively affect life.

### Dailys

A "daily" is a thing that must be done every day at a certain time. eg. Taking Pills. Dailys can also be marked CRITICAL making the system bug you in every possible way (this can go further the more systems we integrate!) till the task is finished!
